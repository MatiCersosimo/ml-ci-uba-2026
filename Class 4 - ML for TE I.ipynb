The standard approach is to do it sequentially, using a \"greedy\" algorithm. We start at the \"root\" of the tree, and \"evaluate\" all possible binary splits across our covariates and their values. \"Evaluate\" here means estimating the total MSE (adding it up region by region) and choosing the split that minimizes it. After we find the split, we assign units to each of the regions depending on whether they fall to one side of the split or the other. For example, if the split is set at $X_{1i} \\geq 0$, all units with $x_i \\geq 0$ will belong to one region, and all units with $x_i < 0$ will belong to the other region. Then, we repeat the process sequentially treating as root each of the regions. We continue doing this until the next split of the feature space does not reduce the total MSE.  \n",
